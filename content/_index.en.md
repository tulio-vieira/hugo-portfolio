  title: "About me"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    As a designer, I work in a facilitating position, balancing user needs, the technical feasibility of solutions and business objectives. But I think UX is a commitment from everyone on the team, not just the designer. I believe that a team that has a sense of ownership and cooperation can evolve to unimaginable levels!
