</h2>

#### Deliverables:
- Quantitative research
- Value offer
- Information architecture
- Style guide
- Prototype
- Usability testing

#### Context
I don't know if you've ever tried to follow the diet that a nutritionist recommends, but sometimes the need to prepare everything with clearly defined items can end up making this work slow and very artisanal. It seems much more practical to order something stupid on these delivery apps, right? Have you ever thought if we could make it as easy to follow nutritional planning as it is to order an X-Morte-Lenta? It was in this context that we started thinking about how to optimize these processes, *if this really was a market demand*.

#### Hypothesis and research
Based on our experiences, we believe that most people who decide to follow a diet have difficulty preparing meals, for whatever reason. To validate this, we sent a semi-structured questionnaire using Typeform. We aimed to understand whether most people are or have been on a diet and why and whether people are or have been to a nutritionist and why.

#### Research results

#### Value proposition canvas
Now we know that the initial hypothesis was right and that we have a considerable audience that sees value in the nutritional plan (we can see this with the high percentage of people who have already followed and continue to follow a diet), but who need a little extra "push" to being able to comply with the food plan (this is evident due to the high number of dropouts). To think about how to connect everything in the best way, we created the value proposition Canvas. It is possible to visualize how our solution would alleviate users' pain, taking into account their objectives and tasks.

#### Conceptualizing the solution
In a practical way, in the first stage of the application, some questions would be asked to understand how the person's measurements are and what their main personal objective would be in terms of health and aesthetics (lose weight, maintain weight, gain mass). Subsequently, a calculator would be used to allow her to know the approximate calories she should consume daily to achieve this goal, taking into account her measurements and level of sedentary lifestyle.

In the next step, Artificial Intelligence would be used to select dishes from restaurants already registered in other delivery applications that fit these calories, that is, if the person is prescribed for breakfast to eat, for example, 500 calories, the application would offer options for healthy dishes with approximately 500 calories. We thought about using other Delivery apps as a database because we researched and discovered that most already offer nutritional tables in the meal descriptions, which would facilitate the AI selection process of dishes.

The idea of maintaining a certain similarity with a common Delivery is based on secondary research by Abrasel which says that the habit of ordering food after the Covid-19 crisis is present in around 60% of Brazilian homes due to the practicality it provides. these apps offer.
Therefore, it is intuitive to think that people would feel more likely to follow a diet within a context to which they are already accustomed - ordering food - rather than having to weigh food and prepare meals alone.

Furthermore, ordering meals would save them from having to do preparation work, which is one of the problems highlighted in the research. And the dishes would be served hot immediately after finishing in the restaurant, which also proved to be relevant to users.
Using the usual food delivery system also helps with the issue of menu rotation, as we will constantly be looking for new dishes to include in the app.

#### Information architecture
In order for the content displayed in the application to be as understandable as possible, we have organized the Information Architecture below.

#### Style Guide
The next step was to define the Style Guide. It will serve as the basis for the interface elements so that the screens have a consistent standard.

#### Screens
After finalizing the wireframes, we created the high-fidelity prototype. The screens you will see below were tested in the next step.

{{< img src="images/ihealthy/screens/10.png" alt="0">}}
{{< img src="images/ihealthy/screens/11.png" alt="0">}}
</div>

#### Usability Testing
At this stage we recruited 5 people to carry out the usability test and, thus, collect feedback to improve the IHealthy application.
The task given was to purchase a meal. The data we obtained were:
* 100% of people reached the end of the task
* 80% said they did not know the amount they were paying
* 60% commented that they did not remember the dish they had selected
* 20% wanted to know when the dish would arrive, but couldn't find it

#### Considerations after usability testing
Given the insights from the usability test, it was clear that for the best user experience, some features should be added, namely:
1. Make the selected merchandise and its value more evident at the time of purchase;
2. Add information about the meal's expected arrival date;

Therefore, the payment and "purchase made" screens have been updated as follows:

#### Conclusion
The initial objective was to help users comply with their diet in a more practical way and, thus, promote physical and emotional well-being.

Research has indicated that most people have already tried to follow a dietary plan, but at some point were discouraged by factors such as lack of time and laziness. Therefore, we sought to develop a solution that would make this process easier and more natural.

It was then that we decided to develop IHealthy, an apparently common Delivery application, but which selects dishes consistent with the calories needed for each individual in a personalized way. This method of meal delivery guarantees a variety on the menu and that the food is served hot, as shown to be extremely important for users.

There are many next steps in the context of IHealthy. We want to add new features according to the needs that users report. To this end, we will keep an eye on reviews in app stores and commit to sending monthly NPs so that we can always provide the best experiences for our users.
